# Health Predictor using ML

This project will use Springboot as the main back-end API. This is because I wanted to simulate a seting where there already existed a health system where people entered various health data and had health data stored, and they wanted to begin incorporating ML into their systems. 

This project will have multiple components: 
1. jupiter notebooks that are used to analyze the data sets, train the models, evaluate the models, then choose thee best prediction model for each condition
2. flask API for utilizing the. created models
3. Springboot back-end that will act as our main API
4. React.js front-end

## ML Models
Various models were trained to predict different health concerns/diseases. The data sets were obtained from kaggle. 

After evaluating the heart prediction models by using the "Heart Disease Dataset" from Kaggle, one was chosen and pickled so it can be used in another app/api

Doing the same with the Diabates Model as well

## Flask API
work in progress, so far set up a basic idea of how it might look and use the created models

## Springboot API
will begin working on it after finished creating/testing the basic functions of the Flask API

## React.js Front-end
Will beginn working on it after finished creating/testing the basic functions of the Spring API
